# Icostring

Generate a file in the ICO format from a short string of either **16** or **64** characters (`'a'..'p', 'q' and 't'`) + an optional hex encoded color value.

The idea is that this can be used for quickly specifying a `favicon.ico` file when writing web applications in Go.

Both a package that is useable from Go and a standalone `genico` command line utility are included.

### Quick installation

For Go 1.17 or later:

    go install github.com/xyproto/icostring/cmd/genico@latest

### Example use

```go
package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"

    "github.com/xyproto/icostring"
)

func main() {
    data, err := icostring.Image("aaaaaaaa aaaqqaaa ffqqqqff ffqqqqff aaqqqqaa aaqqqqaa pppqqppp pppppppp #08f")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
    if err := ioutil.WriteFile("favicon.ico", data, 0644); err != nil {
        log.Fatalln(err)
    }
}
```

### String format

* The string represents a 4x4 or 8x8 image that will be scaled up to 16x16 when it is converted to an ICO.
* The string is a maximum of 73  characters long (letters + hex color). Spaces are ignored.
* The first 4 or 8 letters is the top row, the next series of letters is the second row etc.
* `a` is the darkest grayscale color, `b` is a bit lighter, `c` is a bit lighter than that etc.
* `p` is the lightest grayscale color.
* `q` is a custom color that is either red, or defined at the end of the string with three bytes separated by `:`, like this: `:255:255:255`.
* `t` is transparent.

#### Example image strings

* A dark image: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` (`a` is the darkest grayscale color)
* A blue image: `qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq#00f`. (`q` is the custom color that is optionally defined at the end of the string).
* A red image: `qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq` (the default custom color is red, `#f00`)
* A dark gray square surrounded by transparent pixels: `tttttaattaattttt`.
* A yellow square surrounded by transparent pixels: `tttttqqttqqttttt#ff0`.
* A tiny piece of art: `aaaafqqfaqqapppp#5080ff`.
